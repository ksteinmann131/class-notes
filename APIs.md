**A**pplication
**P**rogram

##### 2 Types:
1. SOAP
  - Simple Object A P
  - much more difficult
2. REST
  - REpresentational State Transfer
  - much simpler url

###### When we're working with rest APIs, we are making a request to a url end point, and usually doing 1 of 4 things (CRUD):
1. POST
  - Create
  - modifies data
2. GET
  - Read
  - brings data back
3. PUT
  - Update
  - modifies data
4. DELETE
  - Delete
  - modifies data
